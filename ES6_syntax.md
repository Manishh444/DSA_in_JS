# ES6 synatx is a major update and this file just have some examples of it.

## Arrow function --->
// how to write arrow fucntion with just one param and return same param.
-let sayName = name => name;
// sayName is a function name and name is  param and since we only return single variable hence no return keyword is needed.

// same arrow function can also be written as 
// let sayName = (name)=> {return name }
